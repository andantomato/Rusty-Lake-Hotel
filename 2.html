<p style="margin-top:45px;">The Cube Escape series was Rusty Lake's first series of games, introducing the Rusty Lake world. Heavily inspired by the TV series Twin Peaks, the series does not have a truly linear order, but mostly follows homicide detective Dale Vandermeer as he investigates the death of a woman and finds himself drawn into the mysterious world of Rusty Lake.</p>
